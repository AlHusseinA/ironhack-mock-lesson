       "The MIT Technology Review explores four key trends that will shape the landscape of artificial intelligence in 2024. The article reflects on previous predictions for 2023 and highlights the following emerging trends:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Customized Chatbots**: Tech companies are expected to focus on developing user-friendly platforms that allow individuals to create customized chatbots tailored to specific needs, without requiring coding skills. This shift aims to make generative AI more accessible for everyday users.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Generative AI‚Äôs Second Wave in Video**: Following the success of image generation AI, the next frontier is in creating text-to-video technologies. Startups are rapidly improving video generation tools, leading to their potential use in major film productions and raising concerns about the implications for actors and the film industry.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **AI-generated Election Disinformation**: With elections looming in 2024, AI-generated disinformation is projected to become a significant issue, with examples from recent elections already showcasing the potential for misleading content. The ease of creating deepfakes poses a challenge for recognition of real versus fake, complicating the political landscape.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Robots that Multitask**: There is a growing trend toward developing more generalized robots that can perform multiple tasks using single models, as opposed to being limited by task-specific capabilities. This could lead to advancements in robotics, especially in areas like autonomous vehicles.\n",
       "\n",
       "As we move into 2024, these trends may impact both the technology landscape and societal dynamics. Each trend carries its own set of challenges and implications, especially concerning reliability, ethical considerations, and regulatory responses."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this notebook, we've explored how the OpenAI API can be leveraged to build practical applications, such as text summarization. The princples introduced also applies to other AI providers like Meta or Anthropic. They also apply to AI systems that use different modalities such as text to image generators or sppech to text, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "The business applications of this text summariser are many. For example,  it summarizing news articles, generating concise overviews for resumes, summarise scientific articles, or crafting subject lines for emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, powerful products can be built when you look at this approach from a big picture point of view. For example, you could use multiple summaries of scientific articles in the last year to produce a grand  summary of where a particular field is heading. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Implications\n",
    "AI products built using OpenAI's API have the potential to improve businesses by driving innovation and improving operations. For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Enhanced Productivity:** Automating repetitive and time-consuming tasks allows teams to focus on more strategic initiatives. This saves a lot of time and person-hours and transfers to higher profitability.\n",
    "- \n",
    "- **Scalability:** AI-driven solutions enable businesses to handle large-scale operations efficiently, such as processing vast amounts of data or serving numerous customers simultaneously. Services like OpenAI's api are built to handle very large volume of requests/traffic. There's a case to be made, however, whether this is wise to do for safety critical systems (say a medical notes summariser deployed in a hospital, what happens if OpenAI's servers are down?)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Personalisation:** If we're building a product for end users, this will add a personal (human?) touch to individual users' experiences. \n",

    "### Future Applications\n",
    "The applications of OpenAI's API are not limited to specific use cases but extend to a broad range of domains and industries. For example, AI can improve  healthcare outcomes by assisting in medical diagnosis, training medical students on interviewing patients, or summarising medical research papers. In education, genAI llms could be used a tutors specialised in specific fields. \n",
    "Business that leverag AI tech, will be able to develop and test mvps from ideas quickly and iterate, all at a minimal cost. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, AI systems can also act as virtual assistants or interactive agents in customer service, providing meaningful user interactions. These technologies promise to bring a new level of convenience to various aspects of daily life and work.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ethics and Regulations\n",
    "As AI becomes more pervasive, it is critical to address ethical considerations and regulatory compliance. Ensuring transparency, fairness, and accountability in AI systems is essential to building trust among users and stakeholders. Bias mitigation, data privacy, and secure deployment are challenges that require continuous attention. Furthermore, these guardrails are more important in critial domains such as healthcare or finance. An AI system misdiagnosing patients' cancers due to gender bias can lead to catastrophic outcomes for that patient. Such precautions, however, may come at the cost of performance, development time, and finacial costs. However, they are vital to consider before deploying any AI powered app to the market. \n",
